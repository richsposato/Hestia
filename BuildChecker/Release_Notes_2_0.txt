Initial Release of Automated Build Checker.

ABC was designed to parse the output files from Visual Studio and summarize the results of the build process
in an HTML file.  It maintains records of previous build results in an HTML table so programmers can see how
well the build process has done in the past.  The intent is so programmers can display build results online
or at least in an internal webpage so everyone can see if any project failed and why.


Changes from verson 1:
1. Recognizes results from more compilers.
2. You can now specify options in a config file.
3. You can now specify custom rules for matching result files.
4. Comes with Code::Blocks project file.
5. You can now specify more options (colors, title, etc...).


Notes:
1. If you want to use a config file, then you must get the UtilParsers library and compile either the
   Debug_w_IniFile or Release_w_IniFile configurations.
2. This project compiles with both GCC and with Visual Studio 9.
