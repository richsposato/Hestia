Design Considerations for C++ Unit Test library:
1. Simple	Library should be easy to compile, and easy to setup within a host
		program.  New users should be able to learn how to use library quickly.
2. Small        Library should have as tiny a memory footprint as possible.
3. Efficient    Big-O complexity of each function should be as small as possible.
4. Polite	Imposes as few as possible requirements on host program.


Changes Since Last Release:
1. SetupForDump function no longer requires specific information such as
   build type, version string, or build number.
2. Modified SetupForDump function so client code can pass in any number of
   keys and values.
3. SetupForDump allows client code to specify location to place dump file
   instead of using default location.
